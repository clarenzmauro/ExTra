Derived from the word Expenses Tracker.

The Expense Tracker Application is a simple console-based program written in C++. It allows users to log their expenses, set a budget, and generate financial reports based on the logged expenses. The application is designed to help users track their spending and manage their finances effectively.

# Features
Set Budget: Users can set their monthly budget by entering a specific amount. The application will use this budget to generate financial reports and provide warnings if the user exceeds the set budget.

Log an Expense: Users can log their expenses by providing details such as the expense ID, name, amount, category, and date. The application stores these logged expenses for later reference and analysis.

View All Logged Expenses: Users can view a comprehensive list of all the expenses they have logged. This feature helps users get an overview of their spending history.

View a Specific Logged Expense: Users can search for a specific expense by providing its ID. If the expense is found, the application displays its details, including the name, amount, category, and date.

Edit a Logged Expense: If users need to update information about a previously logged expense, they can use this feature. Users can edit the name, amount, category, and date of the expense by providing its ID.

Delete a Logged Expense: If an expense is no longer relevant or has been entered incorrectly, users can delete it from the list of logged expenses using this feature.

Get Financial Report: The application generates financial reports based on the logged expenses. These reports include the total expense, the expense for the current month, week, and day. The application also compares the total expense to the set budget and provides a warning if the budget is exceeded.

# How to Use
When you run the application, the main menu will be displayed, showing various options to manage your expenses.

Choose an option by entering the corresponding number. For example, if you want to log an expense, enter 2 and follow the prompts to enter the details of the expense.

You can access other features like viewing all logged expenses, viewing a specific expense, editing an expense, or deleting an expense using the appropriate menu options.

To set your budget, choose option 1 and enter the desired budget amount.

The financial report can be generated by choosing option 7. The report will show the total expense, expenses for the current month, week, and day, along with budget comparison.

To exit the application, choose option 8.

Please note that all logged expenses are saved to a file named "ExpenseTracker.txt," so your data will be retained between application sessions.

Happy expense tracking and budget management!
